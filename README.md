# CV Development Process

This document outlines the process followed to develop my personal CV using the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** methodology. This approach ensures a well-structured, efficient, and polished final product that meets both aesthetic and functional requirements.

## 1. Requirement Gathering and Analysis
   - **Objective**: Identify the key information to include in the CV, such as work experience, education, skills, and achievements.
   - **Activities**: Analyzed job descriptions and industry standards to determine the most relevant sections and layout style. Considered target audience (potential employers, recruiters) and the specific roles of interest.
   - **Outcome**: A list of essential sections and information to be presented in the CV.

## 2. System Design
   - **Objective**: Design the layout, structure, and visual theme for the CV.
   - **Activities**: Created wireframes for the CV layout, choosing fonts, colors, and section organization. Planned the hierarchy of information to make it easy to read and visually appealing.
   - **Outcome**: Design mockup, including layout, fonts, colors, and graphics.

## 3. Implementation (Coding)
   - **Objective**: Develop the CV using HTML, CSS, and relevant libraries, ensuring responsiveness and accessibility.
   - **Activities**: Coded the CV from scratch using HTML for structure and CSS for styling. Incorporated Flexbox/Grid for layout and ensured the design remained responsive across devices.
   - **Outcome**: A functional and visually appealing CV in HTML and CSS format.

## 4. Testing
   - **Objective**: Ensure the CV looks and functions as expected across different devices and browsers.
   - **Activities**: Tested the CVâ€™s responsiveness on various screen sizes, checked compatibility across major browsers, and validated for accessibility and readability.
   - **Outcome**: Bug-free, responsive CV that renders well across devices.

## 5. Deployment
   - **Objective**: Make the CV accessible to recruiters and employers.
   - **Activities**: Hosted the CV on GitHub Pages (or alternative platform), generating a shareable link. Exported the HTML file to PDF format for easy sharing.
   - **Outcome**: Published CV, accessible online and as a downloadable PDF.

## 6. Maintenance
   - **Objective**: Keep the CV updated with new skills, experience, and achievements.
   - **Activities**: Periodically update the content, refine design elements, and improve technical aspects as needed.
   - **Outcome**: An up-to-date, polished CV that reflects my current skills and experience.
